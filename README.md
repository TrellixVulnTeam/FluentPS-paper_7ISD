# FluentPS

Based on PS-Lite

Welcome to cite our paper if using our parameter servers design.

We will soon provide a soild version of the FluentPS design in [Plato](https://github.com/TL-System/plato). It will support Pytorch and Tensorflow as a federated  learning system. If you have any questions, please contact [us](xyao@cs.hku.hk). We will reply to it as soon as possible.
